**['Docker bake'](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/introduction/)**:

Bake is an abstraction for the docker build command that lets you more easily manage your build configuration (CLI flags, environment variables, etc.) in a consistent way for everyone on your team.
Bake is a command built into the Buildx CLI, so as long as you have Buildx installed, you also have access to bake, via the docker buildx bake command.
